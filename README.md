# Symbols

This is my very first SwiftUI/complete Swift project, so I’m painfully aware how terrible the way I do everything is. Apologies in advance.

This is an iOS reference app for SF Symbols. There’s a search bar (that’s incredibly slow…?), tap one to copy the name. It supports dark mode. That is all.
